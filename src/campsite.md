# Caravanning Club overview

This is a Certificated Site (CS). These select sites are small, privately run campsites that operates under the Club’s jurisdiction and can only accommodate up to 5 caravans or motorhomes and up to 10 trailer tents or tents, unless express permission has been given by the Club to accommodate more. They range from secluded Hideaways to fully facilitated family friendly sites, and are often found in locations where larger commercial sites are prohibited so you could be camping close to a beach or in the National Park, for example.
